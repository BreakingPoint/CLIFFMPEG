- Extend source video to 16:9 by blurring+zooming the source and fill the "black bars" with the result (Example: https://i1.creativecow.net/u/269047/example.jpg )
- Preset selection and Q&A skip if selected
- Output result as stream (see https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/StreamingGuide )
- Encode from stream
- Better flexibility on joining different video sources (different resolution sources to one resolution result)
  - Migrate to filter_complex
- Zoom
- Auto clip silence from audio files
